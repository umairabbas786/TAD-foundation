               <p class="mt-3 asdd" style="color: black;">Hockey is not for everyone. It’s time to change that narrative. The Anthony Duclair
                  Foundation’s mission is to ensure that Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC)
                  children are granted safe and equal access to playing hockey in North America. As it
                  stands right now, that population accounts for less than 15% of all hockey players. Those
                  children, specifically, are severely under-represented when compared
                  to the greater North American population. Because of the current systematic barriers that
                  prevent minorities from participating in organized hockey, many of them will never get the
                  opportunity to participate or be exposed to the game. <br><br>
                  We are committed to inspiring a new and diverse generation of hockey players and
                  hockey fans by building the game’s reputation and making it more inclusive from
                  both a cost and culture perspective at the grassroots level. By making hockey
                  accessible and safe for everyone, we will strengthen our connection to each other,
                  to our communities, and to our fans. <br><br>
                  We want to be game changers.
