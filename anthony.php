               </h2>
               <p class="mt-3 asdd" style="color: black;">A child of Haitian immigrants, growing up as a black hockey player was
                  never easy. Anthony’s difficult path has motivated him to knock down
                  barriers and provide equal access and safe environments for people of
                  color to play hockey. <br /><br />
                  Growing up playing the game, Anthony was typically the only black player
                  on his team and often the only black person in the arena. Not a season
                  went by where he didn’t have to face racial slurs from opposing players,
                  discrimination from coaches and even racist remarks from opposing
                  team’s parents. Luckily for him, he always had a strong support system in
                  place and was able to persevere to the highest level of professional
                  hockey and become an NHL All-Star. <br /><br />
                  Unfortunately, most children are not as fortunate as Anthony. The lack of
                  visibility of colored players in the sport continues to stigmatize hockey and
                  create a harmful environment for minorities. As a role model for minority
                  athletes, Anthony takes on the responsibility of making yearly phone calls
                  to children who are suffering from racism and have no one to turn to. <br /><br />
                  Forming the HDA in 2020 with fellow NHL players was a first step in a long
                  battle to combat racism in hockey. Now, Anthony looks to inspire a new
                  and diverse generation of hockey players in the US by giving them a safe
                  opportunity to play the game.
